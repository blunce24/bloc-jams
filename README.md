# BlocJams
Project for Frontend Web Development Foundation

## Summary
For my first project, I set out to build BlocJams, a replica of Spotify, with the guidance of Bloc. The application was a vehicle to learn basic HTML and CSS, as well as front-end programming using vanilla JavaScript and jQuery. I learned a lot through this process and encountered some interesting challenges.
